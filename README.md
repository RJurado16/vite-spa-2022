# vite-spa-2022
React SPA testing plenty libraries for first time

The main purpose is to build a brutally simple SPA to try out alternative tools: Old and accustomed -> New and never tried by myself
- Setup: Create-React-App -> Vite with React
- Routing: react-router -> wouter || react-location
- Forms: formik -> react-hook-forms
- Form Validation: yup -> zod
- State management: redux -> redux-toolkit (rtk) || Jotai
- Styling: design-system libraries (MUI, Bootstrap) -> behavior libraries (RadixUI || HeadlessUI || React-Aria) + boosted CSS (Tailwind || Sass)
